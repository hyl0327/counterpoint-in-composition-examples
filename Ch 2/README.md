# Chapter 2. Second Species  
  
  
# Two-part  
  
  
## Rhythmic Organization  
  
Contrast:  
1. Between two parts  
2. Between strong & weak beats  
  
Beginning:  
1. Two half notes  
2. Half rest + Half note (preferred; produces greater independence)  
  
Ending:  
1. Last measure: a whole note (otherwise inconclusive)  
2. Next-to-last measure:  
    1. (usually) two half notes;  
    2. (often) a whole note (due to CF or VL)  
  
Remainder: two half notes  
  
  
## Dissonant Passing Tone  
  
Types of dissonances:  
1. Passing tone (by motion)  
2. Neighboring note (by ornamentation) (in 3rd and 4th species)  
3. Suspension (by rhythmic displacement) (in 3rd and 4th species)  
  
Must be approached and continued by step  
  
  
## Consonance  
  
Dissonant passing tone occurs only on the second beat  
  
Sometimes the second beat can also be consonant (due to VL or melodic design)  
  
In the measure:  
1. Approached by leap (primarily)  
2. Approached by step (only possible between the 5th and 6th intervals)  
  
Between measures: as in 1st species  
  
No more than 3 consecutive measures should start with the same interval  
  
  
## Perfect Intervals  
  
Unisons:  
1. On second beat: OK; must be left by step in opposite direction  
2. On first beat: No, except for beginning and end; like in 1st species  
  
Parallel 8ves, 5ths, unisons:  
1. Adjacent: Avoid  
2. Successive first beats (a.k.a. accented 5ths/8ves): Avoid; except occasionally:  
    1. 5ths: OK if the second 5th is approached by contrary motion in step, and continued in the same direction by step; this way the second 5th feels less accented  
    2. 8ves: Too accented; avoid generally  
3. Successive second beats: OK  
  
Ottava battuta (beaten 8ve); emphasized by:  
1. a leap in the upper voice,  
2. the contrast between disjunct upper and the stepwise lower parts,  
3. and the rhythmic progression from strong to weak beat,  
should be avoided.  
  
Quinta battuta (similarly for the 5th): Since 5ths are less sensitive, occasional uses are OK  
  
  
## Melodic Organization  
  
Beginning:  
1. 8ve/5th from CF above, or  
2. unison/8ve from CF below  
  
Leading tone in the next-to-last measure:  
1. On the whole note, or  
2. On the second half note  
  
No tying or repeating notes in general (the more possibilities in 2nd species make them no longer necessary)

(In minor) submediant before leading tone: must be raise as well  
  
At least one subsidiary high point before / after the climax  
  
  
## Various Functions of the Second Half Note  
  
Skipped passing (a leap in 3rd that connects two notes a 4th apart):  
1. The leap is between the strong and weak beats (in the measure): preferred  
2. The leap is across the bar line: worse in general, but no problem if followed by a change of direction, preferably stepwise  
(can be dissonant or consonant in compositions; but in exercises, must be consonant)  
  
Subdividing (a leap that connects two notes a 5th or farther apart): must be  
1. consonant,  
2. smaller than or equal to an 8ve, and  
3. followed by contrary motion  
  
Change of register (a large leap between the strong and weak beats):  
1. 5th, 6th, or 8ve (a.k.a. a transfer of register, for the strong continuity of an 8ve)  
2. Should change the immediately preceding direction  
3. Most effective when followed by a continuous line of several tones in stepwise contrary motion  
4. Avoid many consecutive leaps, even with changes of direction  
  
A leap in 4th:  
1. When followed by step in the same direction: like a skipped passing tone; better to change the preceding direction  
2. A substitution for stepwise progression (for variety, or for VL (to avoid parallel 5ths, etc.))  
  
Retarded stepwise motion (a leap that connects two notes a 2nd apart):  
1. The leap is between the strong and weak beats (in the measure): preferred  
2. The leap is across the bar line: the melody had better continue in opposite direction of the leap  
  
In general, a leap across the bar line should effect a change of direction in melody  
  
Consonant neighboring tone (adjacent 5th and 6th):  
1. Retarding to an even greater degree  
2. May risk producing a static line if used often (more suited to the quicker-moving 3rd species)  
3. Can be used to prevent an overly active melodic line  
4. Avoid monotonous repetitions  
  
  
# Three-part  
  
  
## General Considerations; Beginning of Exercise  
  
CF + 1st species part + 2nd species part  
  
If the 2nd part begins with a half rest, then the beginning interval can be:  
1. Unison, 8ve, upper 5th (most stable)  
2. Upper 3rd or 10th (if it leads to good VL)  
(NO: lower 6th (unstable), lower 4th (dissonance))  
  
  
## Cadences  
  
Leading tone can appear in:  
1. 1st part: a whole note  
2. 2nd part: a whole note  
3. 2nd part: the second half note  
  
Leading tone must form part of a complete & consonant chord (corollary: it can't be a dissonant passing tone)  
  
  
## Perfect Intervals  
  
When the 2nd part is in the middle, accented 8ve & 5th between the outer parts (CF & 1st) are more tolerable than in two-part  
  
  
## Imperfect Consonances  
  
Avoid more than three successive parallel 3rds, 6ths, or 10ths between CF & 1st part  
  
  
## Function of the Second Half Note  
  
If the first half of the measure forms an incomplete chord, the second half can complete the chord (while performing a clear and logical melodic function)  
  
In general, they form chords that are equivalent in their contrapuntal functions (VL etc.) to intervals in two-part
