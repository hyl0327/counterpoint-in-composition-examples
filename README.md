# Counterpoint in Composition: Examples

Examples from the book "Counterpoint in Composition", written in Dorico.

I'm currently studying through this book, and I'll keep uploading the examples as I go through them. The examples are from the book, and I just typed them into Dorico, by hand, for studying.

Note: I was just starting to learn Dorico as I began the study of this book, so there might be some errors in the examples, especially in the earlier ones. Also, it's very likely I made wrong use of some functionalities of Dorico here and there, as I must admit I didn't really read the user manual, and instead learned to use it just by doing. PRs to fix them are welcome.
